# Vulkan Playground

This is just a testbed for learning and experimenting with Vulkan, it is not meant to be an example of best C++/Vulkan practices and may not even compile at any given time.

## Requirements

- Vulkan 1.0 capable GPU
- SDL2
- LunarG SDK

## Building

The project uses plain Makefiles, so no aditional tooling is needed. Just run `make` at the root of the project and that should be it.
